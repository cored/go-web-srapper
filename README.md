# Go Concurrent Web Scraper: My Learning Journey

## 🚀 About This Project

My journey of learning and implementing concurrent programming in Go through the development of a web scraper.

As I build this project, I'm exploring key concepts like goroutines, channels, and rate limiting, all while adhering to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Master Go concurrency patterns
- Build a high-performance web scraper
- Implement and understand rate limiting in concurrent systems
- Practice Test-Driven Development
- Document my learning process and discoveries

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Go 1.16+
- Standard library (net/http, sync, etc.)
- Testing framework: built-in `testing` package

## 📘 What I'm Learning

- Effective use of goroutines and channels
- Concurrent design patterns in Go
- Performance optimization techniques
- Error handling in concurrent systems
- TDD practices in Go

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `go test ./...` to execute the tests
4. Run `go run cmd/scraper/main.go` to start the scraper

## 📝 Notes and Observations

(I'll be updating this section as I progress through the project, documenting key learnings, challenges, and breakthroughs.)

## 📚 Resources I'm Using

- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go)
- [Go Concurrency Patterns](https://talks.golang.org/2012/concurrency.slide)
- [The Go Blog: Pipelines and Cancellation](https://blog.golang.org/pipelines)

## 🤔 Questions I'm Exploring

- What's the optimal balance between concurrency and rate limiting?
- How can I ensure my concurrent code is both efficient and maintainable?
- What are the best practices for error handling in concurrent Go programs?

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my learning journey!
